Click it to whitelist the channel, the page will refresh (with ADs, yayy), and the heart will turn orange (like this one => ðŸ§¡).

### Why orange and not red?
First it is the Dutch color, second red is communist.
JK, for some reason red heart was glitched on Linux so I picked the closest one to red IMO.
